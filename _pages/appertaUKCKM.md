          <center><h3>Clincal Knowledge Manager (CKM)</h3></center>
          <center><h5>1st November 2024</h5></center><br>
          <p>Announcing the temporary suspension of the Apperta Foundation UK Clinical Knowledge Manager (CKM). For many years, CKM has been a vital tool for the curation and governance of clinical models, supporting countless UK healthcare projects and fostering collaboration across the industry.</p>
          <p>While we face the challenge of pausing the service due to a lack of committed funding from past and present contributors, we remain optimistic about the future. The importance of CKM in supporting clinical governance and advancing digital health remains clear, and we are hopeful that renewed contributions from organizations will allow us to bring this valuable resource back into action.</p>
          <p>We are incredibly grateful for the ongoing support from our community and extend our sincere thanks to all who have supported the UK CKM and contributed to its success over the years. We look forward to exploring opportunities that will enable CKM to continue making a positive impact in the years to come.</p>
          <p>If you, or your organisation are in a position to financially contribute to the provision of this service, then please contact <a href="mailto:info@apperta.org">info@apperta.org</a></p>
          <p>All content hosted on the UK CKM will remain available in our GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/AppertaFoundation/apperta-uk-ckm-mirror" target="_blank">Apperta UK CKM Mirror</a></p>
          <p>We hope to be able to reconstitute the service as soon as funding commitments are made.</p>
