bio: Ajay Malviya is a Consultant Orthopaedic Surgeon at Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust. He trained in the Northern Deanery and has done specialist fellowships in hip preservation and joint replacement surgery in Cambridge, London and Switzerland.  He is an expert in hip arthroscopy for femoroacetabular impingement, trochanteric pain syndrome and periacetabular osteotomy for hip dysplasia using a minimally invasive approach. In his routine practice he deals with sports injuries of the hip and has published and presented widely on the results of hip arthroscopy in athletes and general population. He has completed a PhD on the role of hip arthroscopy in femoroacetabular impingement. Preservation of the hip joint is his principle philosophy but he has a wide experience of joint replacement surgery catering to the young population, if necessary. Ajay also serves as a board member for the Non-Arthroplasty Hip Registry and is an advocate of the use of PROMs data to inform clinical practice.
